* Snake3D

The game snake in 3D! Could it get any better?


* How to Run?
#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
lein deps
lein native-deps
lein run
#+END_SRC

* How to play?
1) Use the arrow keys up, left, right, down to change the direction of the snake.
2) Eat the yellow food.
3) Don't eat your tail!


* How did I build this?
I built this in the span of 8 hours with essentially zero opengl experience. I was playing around with the library penumbra for clojure and realized how easy it was to build stuff.
